<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was my first end to end project and involved using all the skills I have learned so far as part of the bootcamp at Ironhack. We were provided with a dataset containing information about customers of a bank who were offered a credit card as part of a marketing campaign. The aims of the project were as follows:  

- To create a database in MYSQL workbench based on the CSV file we received and carry out some data analysis answering various questions using SQL queries.
- Pull the data into a pandas dataframe in a juypter notebook and then carry out some EDA and data cleaning.
- To build a machine learning algorithm in python which could identify customers who accepted the credit card offer.
- Finally to analyse the data, identify trends and build dashboards in Tableau.
- To plan and implement the project using agile project management with a Kanban board on Github.

## Stage 1 - SQL





<!-- Stage 2 -->
## Stage 2 - Python

### Preamble

The main aim of this stage of the project was to build a classification machine learning algorithm in python using the credit card marketing data which would identify whether customers accepted or rejected a credit card offer. The dataset is heavily imbalanced towards one class of the target variable as around 94% of customers said no to the credit card offer and only 6% said yes. 

### Workflow

- 



<!-- Stage 3 -->
## Stage 3 - Tableau

### Premable

In this part of the project I worked with the credit card marketing dataset in Tableau. As we saw in Stage 2 around 94% of customers accepted the company's offer of a credit card and around 6% rejected it. The aim of the analysis at this stage was to see if we could find out any interesting facts about the demographics of customers who accepted the offer compared to ones who didn't and visualise the answers to such questions using sheets and dashboards in Tableau.

### Findings

My Tableau file containing all the sheets and dashboards I created is available to view in the files folder.
