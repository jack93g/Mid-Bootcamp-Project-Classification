# Mid-Bootcamp-Project-Classification

## Brief summary of project  

- The first step was creating a database of credit card customers in SQL and carrying out some basic analysis of the data using SQL queries
- Then I imported the data into a pandas dataframe and did some EDA and data cleaning
- The aim of this stage was to create a classfication algorithm that could identify which customers said yes to the offer of a credit card and which said no
- I used logistic regression with different sampling methods and KNN
- Finally I did a deep dive into the data in tableau creating some dashboards to visualise various questions


## Stage 1 - SQL



## Stage 2 - Data cleaning and EDA 

- exploring and cleaning the data in python

## Stage 3 - Trying out different models to predict the target variable

- data preprocessing and fitting the models
- logistic regression and knn

## Stage 4 - Conclusions 

- which model was the best  

## Stage 5 - Data analysis in Tableau
