<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## **About The Project**

This project was my first end to end project and involved using all the skills I have learned so far as part of the data anlytics bootcamp at Ironhack. We were provided with a dataset containing information about bank customers who were offered a credit card as part of a marketing campaign. The main objective of this project was to build a classification algorithm in python which would identify which customers accepted the credit card offer and which ones didn't. We also had to create a database of the credit card marketing data in MYSQL workbench and carry out some SQL queries to answer various questions and then finally deepdive into the data in Tableau and create some visualisations and dashboards.

<!-- Workflow -->
## **Workflow**

- To create a database in MYSQL workbench based on the dataset we received and carry out some data analysis using SQL queries.
- Pull the data into a pandas dataframe and then do some exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.
- To build a machine learning algorithm in python which could identify whether a customer accepted the offer or not.
- To deepdive into the data in Tableau, creating visualisations and dashboards.
- To plan and implement the project using agile project management with a Kanban board on Github.
